This project focuses on anomaly detection in smart meter data using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing time-series energy consumption data, the goal is to identify unusual patterns or outliers that may indicate electricity theft, meter malfunctions, or abnormal usage behavior. Various ML models such as Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting were compared alongside DL architectures like LSTM and CNN to handle the temporal nature of the data. The project not only showcases model building and evaluation but also emphasizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to deliver actionable insights for utility providers.
